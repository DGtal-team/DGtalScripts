This repository contains scripts to help DGtal developers.

Developper tools
================

Scripts and models to create a DGtal class, a DGtal template class, a documentation,....

To use these scripts to generate files, you need 
   - to create a profile file (see ```dev/profiles/*.defs```) 
   - to specify to environment variables (e.g. in your .bashrc or .profile):
     - ${DGtal}: path to your clone of the DGtal source repository
     - ${DGtalScripts}: path to your clone of the DGtalScripts repository

Then, you can add ${DGtalScripts$}/dev/scripts to your $PATH variable.
